PANIC BUTTONS:
 - Instant Camera Mode : Press and Release Select/Back
 - Instant Pointer Mode : Press and Release Select/Back, then press R3 (click Right Stick). 
 - Instant normal Windows Operation : Use Instant Pointer Mode, or alternatively, just click (and release) the right mouse button. 
 - NOTE: Due to how Guild Wars 2 handles Camera Mode, every time you lose control of your character, be it because of a cinematic sequence (like a story sequence or a vista) or a loading screen (both from zoning and teleporting far away), you'll have to press and release Select/Back to reset to Camera Mode. This will become natural after a while.
 - NOTE: Due to a bug in XPadder's set changing logic (i.e. nothing we can do anything about), it's possible to be locked into the wrong set if certain combinations of shift keys are pressed in certain sequences. The latest version should set everything back to the right mode simply by pressing and releasing Select/Back in most cases; if this doesn't do the trick, just move in any direction, then press and release Select/Back again.
